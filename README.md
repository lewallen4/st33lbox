Welcome to st33lbox! This project aims to create a post-quantum algorithm secure machine that can be instantly deployable to a Virtual Machine (VM). Our goal is to provide a secure, ready-to-use environment with robust firewall settings and SSH configurations. Let's dive in!
Project Overview

st33lbox sets up a secure VM environment by:

    Installing essential security tools like firewalld and openssl.
    eventually making a quantum ready tunnel.
    Configuring the firewall to allow only necessary ports and block all others.
    Ensuring your VM is hardened and ready to defend against potential threats.

<b><h3>Getting Started</b></h3>

To deploy st33lbox, follow these steps:



<b><h3>Prerequisites</b></h3>

Ensure your VM has:

    A Debian-based OS (e.g., Ubuntu)
    Python 3 installed
    Sudo privileges

<b><h3>Installation</b></h3>

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/st33lbox.git
    cd st33lbox

Run the setup script:

    chmod +x setup.sh
    ./setup.sh




<b><h3>Logs</b></h3>

All actions performed by the scripts are logged in logs.log. This includes key generation, firewall configurations, and any errors encountered during the process.
